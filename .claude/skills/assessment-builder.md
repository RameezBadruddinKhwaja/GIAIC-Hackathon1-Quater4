## Purpose
Design comprehensive assessments with rubrics, scoring criteria, and module evaluations.

## Key Patterns

### Module Assessment Structure
```markdown
## Part 1 Assessment: The Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Duration**: 90 minutes
**Format**: Mixed (Theory 40% + Practical 60%)
**Passing Score**: 70/100

### Section A: Theory (40 points)

**Question 1** (10 points): Explain the advantages of DDS middleware over ROS 1's master-based architecture.

**Rubric**:
- 10 pts: Complete explanation with 3+ advantages and technical details
- 7 pts: Good explanation with 2 advantages
- 4 pts: Basic explanation with 1 advantage
- 0 pts: Incorrect or missing

**Question 2** (10 points): Draw and label a ROS 2 publisher-subscriber architecture diagram.

...

### Section B: Practical (60 points)

**Challenge 1** (30 points): Create a ROS 2 package with:
- Custom message type (10 pts)
- Publisher node (10 pts)
- Subscriber node (10 pts)

**Rubric**:
- Code compiles and runs: 15 pts
- Follows ROS 2 conventions: 10 pts
- Proper error handling: 5 pts

**Challenge 2** (30 points): Implement service-based communication...
```

### Scoring Criteria
- **Excellent (90-100)**: Exceeds requirements, demonstrates deep understanding
- **Good (80-89)**: Meets all requirements, solid understanding
- **Satisfactory (70-79)**: Meets minimum requirements
- **Needs Improvement (<70)**: Incomplete or incorrect

### Self-Assessment Format
```markdown
## Self-Assessment Checklist

Rate your confidence (1-5) on each objective:

**Week 1: ROS 2 Basics**
- [ ] Install ROS 2 Humble: ☐☐☐☐☐
- [ ] Create publisher nodes: ☐☐☐☐☐
- [ ] Debug node issues: ☐☐☐☐☐

**Average Score**: ___ / 5

If < 3.5, review Week 1 materials before proceeding.
