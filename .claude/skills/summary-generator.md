# summary-generator Skill

## Purpose
Generate concise chapter summaries and TL;DR sections with key takeaways.

## Key Patterns

### Chapter Summary Structure
```markdown
## Key Takeaways

- ✅ ROS 2 uses a distributed architecture with DDS middleware
- ✅ Nodes communicate via topics using publish-subscribe pattern
- ✅ Python and C++ are both fully supported
- ✅ Quality of Service (QoS) policies enable real-time reliability
- ✅ ROS 2 command-line tools are essential for debugging

## Next Steps

In **Week 2**, we'll dive deeper into:
- ROS 2 Topics architecture
- Custom message types
- Publisher-Subscriber patterns
- Topic remapping and namespaces
```

### TL;DR Format
```markdown
:::tip TL;DR
**This Week**: ROS 2 Basics - Install ROS 2 Humble, create your first publisher/subscriber nodes, understand DDS middleware.

**Prerequisites**: Ubuntu 22.04 or Docker environment.

**Time Commitment**: 6-8 hours (2-3 hours theory, 4-5 hours hands-on).

**Outcome**: Working "Hello Robot" publisher-subscriber pair.
