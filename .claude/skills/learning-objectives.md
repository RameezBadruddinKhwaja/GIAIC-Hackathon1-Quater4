# learning-objectives Skill

## Purpose
Define clear, measurable learning outcomes using Bloom's Taxonomy.

## Key Patterns

### Bloom's Taxonomy Levels
1. **Remember**: Recall facts (define, list, identify)
2. **Understand**: Explain concepts (describe, explain, summarize)
3. **Apply**: Use knowledge (implement, execute, demonstrate)
4. **Analyze**: Break down information (compare, contrast, differentiate)
5. **Evaluate**: Make judgments (assess, critique, justify)
6. **Create**: Produce new work (design, build, develop)

### Learning Objective Format
```markdown
## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- ✅ **Remember**: Define DDS middleware and its role in ROS 2
- ✅ **Understand**: Explain the publisher-subscriber communication pattern
- ✅ **Apply**: Create a Python publisher node that sends messages at 1 Hz
- ✅ **Analyze**: Compare ROS 1 and ROS 2 architecture differences
- ✅ **Evaluate**: Assess when to use topics vs services vs actions
- ✅ **Create**: Build a complete ROS 2 package with custom messages
```

### Measurable Outcomes
**Good** (Measurable):
- "Create a ROS 2 publisher node"
- "Explain 3 advantages of DDS"
- "Implement error handling in nodes"

**Bad** (Not Measurable):
- "Understand ROS 2"
- "Know about DDS"
- "Learn publishing"

### Weekly Progression
- **Weeks 1-3**: Focus on Remember + Understand
- **Weeks 4-7**: Focus on Apply + Analyze
- **Weeks 8-13**: Focus on Evaluate + Create

## Usage Context
- Week planning
- Assessment design
- Progress tracking
- Curriculum validation
