# mvp-builder Skill

## Purpose
Identify and prioritize MVP features for rapid delivery and validation.

## Key Patterns

### MVP Prioritization Framework
**P0 (Must Have)** - Core functionality:
- 13-week textbook content
- Docusaurus frontend
- Basic navigation

**P1 (Should Have)** - Value enhancers:
- Mermaid diagrams
- Code examples with tabs
- Search functionality

**P2 (Nice to Have)** - Bonus features:
- RAG chatbot (+50 pts)
- Authentication (+50 pts)
- Personalization (+50 pts)

### MVP Definition Template
```markdown
## MVP Scope

**Goal**: Deliver base 100/100 hackathon points

**In Scope**:
- ✅ 13 weeks of content (Weeks 1-13)
- ✅ 4-part curriculum structure
- ✅ Mermaid diagrams in key sections
- ✅ Code examples with Docusaurus Tabs
- ✅ Hardware Lab Guide (4 files)
- ✅ Responsive Docusaurus theme

**Out of Scope (Defer to Phase 2)**:
- ❌ RAG chatbot
- ❌ User authentication
- ❌ Personalization
- ❌ Translation
- ❌ ROS2 code generator

**Success Criteria**:
- All 13 weeks have complete content
- Local build succeeds
- Navigation works correctly
- Code examples are tested
```

### Feature Validation
Ask for each feature:
1. Does it contribute to base 100/100 points? → MVP
2. Does it add bonus points? → Phase 2
3. Does it improve UX but no points? → Phase 3

## Usage Context
- Project planning
- Sprint prioritization
- Hackathon strategy
- Resource allocation
